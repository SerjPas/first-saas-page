Assignment_2_SaaS_Page
Follow the Figma design to create you first SaaS (software as a service) page
The page should be responsive and look good in a mobile device, you even have a design for mobile.
The page should look exactly as the design! we don't want the designers yell at us that the website doesn't look like they wanted :/
Use bootstrap to code the website faster.
You DO NOT need the create the charts using HTML & CSS, you can just export them from Figma as images, and insert them in your website.
Take the sizes, spaces, colors, fonts, icons and images from the Figma design.
